## :wrench: Job Responsiblities

To whomsoever it may concern;
    I am currently an Associate Professor at the Department of Computer Science, Symbiosis International University, India. I am extremely interested in obtaining a position where I can contribute to its focus on engineering education, continue my research on acoustic and sound, assistive technologies,  wearable and non-wearable sensing for healthcare and monitoring, Data Analytics for healthcare/ Security monitoring and forecasting, Lifestyle pattern modeling, Machine learning for decision-making and lead campus-related professional service activities, and computer vision. My ten years of research and teaching experience working as an Associate Professor and Assistant Professor prepare me to be an effective researcher and instructor in your department. My doctoral dissertation was conducted in the area of Wireless Sensor Network under Prof. K. H. Wandra and examined the application of a relatively new wireless protocol to design a secure centralized and clustered wireless sensor network.  During my Ph. D. research endeavor, I have developed my skills in heterogeneous wearable and non-wearable sensors based on wireless Communications and network designing. I have learned the skills of big-data handling, developing data mining and machine learning algorithms to extract decision-making information, followed by using the internet of things (IOT).
At Symbiosis Centre for Applied Artificial Intelligence, I have carried out researches in the area of acoustics and sound technologies such as detection of lifestyles based on unknown activities of a residence, COPD detection, the development of a fall detection system, and providing real-time assistance with the help of automation and robotics. Recently, I am working on the detection and monitoring of Cardiac arrest conditions using Librosa machine learning libraries. Additionally, I have developed various prototypes of IoT-based sensor-fusion assistive technology for COVID-19 disinfection, Indoor, and Outdoor Pollution Monitoring Prediction system, smart home anti-theft system, and many more. This research work has been published in peer-reviewed journals and books (IEEE, Elsevier, Taylor and Francis, MDPI, and Emerald). I am excited to share and continue exploring this methodology and collaborating with your department faculty to expand its potential. I am a reviewer for reputed journals (IEEE IoT, IEEE Sensors, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, IEEE Access, Transactions on emerging telecommunication technologies, peerJ Computer Science, etc.) and conference papers. I have completed all Ph.D. research within three years, which shows my willingness, potential, and caliber to contribute in research. In addition to my dissertation research, other areas that interest me for my future research stem from my goal of developing improved wireless sensing for healthcare and rehabilitation using acoustics. I have also evaluated and improved accuracy for the innovative theft detection system with big data handling aspects in real-time. There are just some projects I have planned to continue and grow with the support of the Symbiosis Centre for Applied Artificial Intelligence, Swinburne University, Australia, Massey University NZ, and Fudan University Shanghai, China. I have received two research grants. With the title, An efficient load balancing algorithm for Cloud Computing, Department of Science and Technology, India, has granted the research fund for the year 2016-2018, and Ablation Studies on Reentry Capsule with Strong Coupling to flow dynamics, Department of Defense and Development Organization(DRDO), India, has granted the research fund for the year 2019-2021. During my master's degree at Swinburne University, Australia, I have developed the skills to design and build radio frequency integrated circuit design using EDA tools. After my master's degree, I worked as an IT manager for a couple of years and explored whatever I had learned during my master's degree. I found that my professional experience as an engineer provided me with a broad view that helps students with projects and assignments. I have also published three patents on "A Novel Unsupervised Video Surveillance System, Remotely operable systems use gestures or voice commands, System of turning on or off vehicle systems using a smartphone." 
   In my recent work, I realize wireless acoustic frameworks for Cardiac Arrest monitoring and detection, risk classification, classification of Dementia, Parkinson's, Asthma, etc. The system collects the sensory information from the microphone sensors, analyzes it using various Librosa machine learning libraries, and classifies the acoustic events using deep learning methodologies. This project has research challenges related to physiological signal extraction, big data analytics, wireless sensing, and in-depth learning designing. I am also involved in the research associated with Ambient Acoustic Event Assistive Framework for Identification, Detection, and Recognition of Unknown Acoustic Events of a Residence to monitor elderly lifestyles, IoT-based COVID19 disinfection tunnel, indoor and outdoor air pollution monitoring and prediction, and auto facemask detection, and thermal scanning system.
My maturity, practical experience, and eagerness to enter into your group make me an excellent candidate. I would love to continue my career with your institute. I am confident that I would be a beneficial addition to you.
If you require any additional materials or information, I am happy to supply it. Thank you very much for your consideration.
Thank you for your time and consideration 
Best Regards
Sharnil Pandya
